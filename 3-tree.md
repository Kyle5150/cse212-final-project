# Tree

The **tree** data structure is a unique data structure in which data items are connected using references in a hierarchical manner. A tree consists of a root node and a combination of internal nodes (also known as vertices) and edges. A node is where we store data, and an edge is a path between two nodes.

In python, a process called **recursion** is used when dealing with trees. Recursion is the process of defining something in terms of itself. A real world example would be to place two parallel mirrors facing each other. Any object in between them would be reflected recursively.

A tree whose elements have at most two children is called a **binary tree**. Each element in a binary tree can have only two children.

A **binary search tree**, or BST for short, is a tree whose nodes store a key that is greater than all of their left child nodes and less than all of their right child nodes. Binary trees are useful for storing data in an organized manner so that it can be quickly retrieved, inserted, updated, and deleted.

## Recursion

Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself.

This is an example of a recursive function.
```python
def recurse():
  recurse()
recurse()
```
This function will call the 'recurse()' function forever.

To properly use recursion, there are two rules to always follow:
1. Smaller Problem
2. Base Case

## Binary Trees

## Binary Search Tree (BST)

## BST Operations

## Problem to Solve: Complete the Tree

* Remember there is never simply one solution!
