# Set
Unlike a stack, the set data structure does not operate based on the location of each item within. Order does not matter in a set. It is created by using curly braces (my_set = {1, 2, 3}) in python.

Sets also do not allow duplicate values within them. With the use of **hashing**, the set data structure can add, remove, and check for values being present in the set more efficiently than any other data structure.

Using the set data structure can raise some issues when dealing with filled spots within the set. Techniques such as **open addressing** and **chaining** solve these conflicts:
