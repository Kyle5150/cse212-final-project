# Set
Unlike a stack, the set data structure does not operate based on the location of each item within. The order does not matter.

Sets also do not allow duplicate values within them. With the use of **hashing**, the set data structure can add, remove, and check for values being present more efficiently than any other data structure.

When using a set, you inherently are using a **sparse list** because sparse lists only have one place for each unique value to be stored, giving the set this characteristic.
