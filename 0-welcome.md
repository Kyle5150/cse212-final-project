# Python Data Structure Tutorial
Welcome to the python data structure tutorial. Data structures are the basic constructs around which programs are built. Each data structure provides a particular way of organizing data so it can be accessed efficiently, depending on the use case. These are some (but not all) of the most common data structures used:

- [Stack](https://github.com/Kyle5150/cse212-final-project/blob/main/1-stack.md)
- [Set](https://github.com/Kyle5150/cse212-final-project/blob/main/2-set.md)
- [Tree](https://github.com/Kyle5150/cse212-final-project/blob/main/3-tree.md)

Each module will contain descriptions and examples. At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own. You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
